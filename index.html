                <h2>About Us</h2> <br>
                <p>
                    Manners Estate Liquidation (MEL) is a trusted provider of fast, profitable, and professionally managed estate sales throughout New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and New York. <br><br>

                    Based in Robbinsville, NJ, MEL is a boutique business with over 35 years of combined industry experience, offering clients top-tier service while ensuring they retain the largest possible share of their estate sale proceeds. <br><br>
                    MEL is owned and operated by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/michael-manners-919ba81b9/" target="_blank"> Michael Manners</a>, who, along with his father Brian, brings both a personal touch and deep professional expertise to every sale. Together, they manage each project hands-on—from initial consultation to final clean-out—ensuring a seamless, respectful, and efficient experience for their clients. <br><br>
                    Brian Manners is a seasoned estate liquidation expert with decades of experience in auction houses, antiques, and resale markets. He’s fond of American Arts and Crafts furniture, Native American artifacts, and stained-glass collectibles—areas in which he is recognized as a knowledgeable and discerning collector. <br><br>
                    Michael Manners comes from a background in financial consulting sales, combining strategic insight with operational know-how. After years of assisting with estate sales alongside his father, he founded MEL to provide homeowners—especially those looking to downsize—with a more affordable and transparent alternative to the high-commission estate sale firms that dominate the market. <br><br>
                    At MEL, we specialize in working with individuals and families transitioning to smaller homes, settling estates, or simply seeking to declutter. We pride ourselves on honest pricing, personalized service, and maximizing value for our clients, all while treating each home and its contents with care and respect.
                    If you’re downsizing or managing a family estate, Manners Estate Liquidation is ready to help you turn a lifetime of possessions into lasting value—quickly, respectfully, and profitably.

    <h2>10 Steps To The Sale</h2> <br>

    <p>
1: Consultation- During a consultation, MEL will figure out the best time to host your sale, ask questions about the items in your estate, discuss your timeline, and answer any immediate questions you have! <br><br>
2: Q&A- MEL makes itself available at all hours. After the initial consultation arises, you may have questions about the sale. You can call Michael any time at 609-865-2525 to get that extra insight. <br><br>
3: Estate Sale Agreement- Once your questions are answered, we’ll send along our Estate Sale Agreement, which outlines the terms of the sale. <br><br>
4: Discovery- This is where MEL familiarizes itself with the contents of your estate. You’ll point out those special items that you have, and we’ll agree upon the best price for those items. Here, we will also take pictures of the items. <br><br>
5: Advertising- We’ll take those pictures, and we will make this sale known! We’ll use all our advertising channels to drive people to the sale to maximize profitability. This will be of no expense to you! <br><br>
6: Research- This is our favorite part! Here, we take our time to truly learn the ins and outs of your estate. We’ll know every item and its worth, for the sake of bringing you the largest number possible on the final day of the sale. <br><br>
7: Set Up- At this stage, we will go to the estate and move everything into place. We’ll display the items in the home so that they are easy to access and attract attention. This stage typically happens on the Thursday or Friday night before the sale. <br><br>
8: The Sale- Now, we will execute the sale. Typical sales are conducted from 10AM – 3PM on a Saturday and Sunday, but depending on the estate size, this can change. <br><br>
9: Payment- Here, you’ll receive access to your funds from the sale. <br><br>
10: After the sale- If you have any questions that arise once the sale is over, you can contact us, and we will be there to help!
